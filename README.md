A quick vibe coded GUI based tool to split large PDFs into small 'n' number of PDFs based on the no. of pages you specify. 
1. See total no. of pages before you split so that you can decide how many pages you need in each
2. Select output folder.
3. A progress bar which I am not sure is working 100%
